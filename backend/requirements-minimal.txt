# MINIMAL DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS (< 500MB)
# This file includes only essential dependencies for Cloud Run deployment
# Heavy ML libraries (torch, sentence-transformers) are excluded

# FastAPI and server

uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
python-multipart==0.0.6

# Data models and validation
pydantic==2.5.0
pydantic-settings==2.1.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# Document processing (REQUIRED for templates)
python-docx==1.1.0

# Database support
sqlalchemy==2.0.23
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
alembic==1.12.1

# Authentication and Security (REQUIRED)
passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4
python-jose[cryptography]==3.3.0

# Caching (lightweight, gracefully disabled if unavailable)
redis==5.0.1

# Async support
aiofiles==23.2.1

# Google Gemini AI (REQUIRED for report generation)
google-generativeai==0.8.3
protobuf<5

# Email validation
email-validator>=2.0.0

# EXCLUDED HEAVY DEPENDENCIES (Optional features):
# - torch>=2.0.0 (~2GB) - Only needed for vector embeddings
# - sentence-transformers - Only needed for semantic search
# - transformers - Only needed for advanced NLP
# - qdrant-client - Only needed for vector database
# - spacy - Only needed for advanced NLP
# - openai-whisper - Only needed for server-side transcription (we use browser speech API)
#
# These features are disabled but the app remains fully functional:
# ✅ Report generation (Gemini API)
# ✅ Template matching (keyword-based)
# ✅ Authentication (JWT)
# ✅ Document export (Word/PDF)
# ✅ Database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
# ❌ Semantic search (vector embeddings)
# ❌ Server-side voice transcription (browser speech API still works)
